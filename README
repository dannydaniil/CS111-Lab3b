Our project successfully passes the sanity
script provided on the specification for the project.

We chose to use python2 as the programming language to
keep our source code short and for easier manipulation
of the contents of the file provided as the argument.

lab3b:
A shell script that is used to run lab3b.py which
is our source code file. Script lab3b simply passes
the argument provided to the python source file
which produces the required results.

lab3b.py:



Makefile:
contains the three specified commands, make, make clean
and make dist. The make command simply gives execution
permission to the two scripts lab3b lab3b.py . There is
nothing produce during the make command, therefore the clean
command does not remove any file. Finally, the dist command
create the tar that contains the project's files.


README:
contains a description for each included file in our
submission.
